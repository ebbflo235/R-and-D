# R-and-D

I am a user of existing GitHub repositories now uploading some of my own work.

Code is divided into two folders

1)Auto_trade_scripts. I use these scripts to execute trades in python through interactive brokers api. The code is not in production format.

2)Notebooks. This is a collection of quantitative research projects and corresponding data. I have committed two jupyter notebooks , the first focuses on timing equity entry using the VIX and the second is a survey of statistical arbitrage techniques in the US such as principal component analysis and residual regression analysis. Current work is an extension of notebook two where I use quandl data to analyze company fundamentals with quandl databases. Please not these scripts will not run unless you have your own existing quandl subscription.

My hope is that people will be able to use bit and pieces of my code / research in their own ideas while I build a functional repository.
